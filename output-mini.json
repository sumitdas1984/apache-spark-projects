The job history page says to go back \"at least 10 years.\"  Ten years ago, I was 16.  I was working at Best Buy, and I hated it.  I should note, though, that I saw my old manager working at Audio King (back when it was called Audio King), many months ago.  Then there was Media Play... then Hollywood Video... I can\\'t believe that an international aid organization would find my ability to upsell Packard Bells, or say in what section  Femalien  resides, remotely interesting.

Someone, somewhere (probably pretty close to here, actually), is going to open up this domain expecting to see handsome video game Cratchit digging his way out of a sand trap, only to find I\\'m on the blogging track again.

Well, maybe not right away, but eventually, I hope.  I\\'ve been feeling more than a little anxious the past few months.  Life as a web developer has sort of burned me out, and I think I\\'d like to try something different... something that will get me closer the Great Life Goal I\\'m shooting for.  I\\'m not sure what the Goal is exactly, but I get the feeling I\\'ll never get there on my current course.

What\\'s a significant experience  you\\'ve  had with adapting to a different culture?  You\\'d think that a three month stint in Europe would make a question of this kind really easy to answer, but it doesn\\'t... tourism, as it turns out, doesn\\'t really lend itself to forcing you adapt to anything other than washing your clothes in a sink.  I wish I could say I\\'ve needed to wipe my butt with a leaf once in my life, but that\\'s just not the case... hence, my application to the PC.    Back to the story, then.  I filled up the huge PC envelope last night and sent it on its way this morning.  There\\'s an education addendum that I decided against filling out, only because it would have been a pretty pathetic-looking effort.  My IT addendum, on the other hand, was five pages long.

Managed to skirt around conversation relating to this on Sunday, when I visited the parents. Actually, I haven\\'t yet told them that I\\'ve actually started the application process, only that I\\'ve been thinking seriously about it.

My mother is a veritable encyclopedia of horror stories about international travel.  \"Didn\\'t you hear about those people in Honduras two years ago that were tortured and killed?\"  \"Didn\\'t you hear about that couple in Mexico that they put in jail and wanted $10,000 from?

Like I\\'ve said before, my capacity for churning out long form answers that are semi-coherent has been damaged by one too many English classes over the years.  More often than not, I come off sounding like a damn moron... or maybe I always sounded that way, and all of those English classes just helped me to recognize my own moronitude.  Setback: I called today to register for ESL pre-training classes, but it turns out they were completely full for the month.  OK.  August, then.  Now I won\\'t be able to sit down and actually tutor anyone until sometime in September.  Too many do-gooders in this world, I tell you.  This weekend: Friday, I did very little.  Saturday, I tried to see the Grand Excursion, but the boats were late, and it started to rain.  Plus, I didn\\'t care.  Jer and I hooked up PSX controllers to the computer and played some old arcade games via MAME.  You know MAME, right?  Of course you do.  Everyone comes back to MAME once a year to remember just how bad most of the games were they drooled over years ago.  Remember \"Narc\" and \"Bad Dudes\"?  Terrible, terrible games ( \"I\\'m bad!\" ).  \"Final Fight\" still seems decent, and thankfully shows that not  all  of those precious quarters were wasted.  Ahh, to be back in the K-mart arcade playing \"Altered Beast\" and \"Time Warriors\"...  Sunday, I sat around some more.  While everyone else was watching fireworks, I was sitting through \"Fahrenheit 9-11\".  In a nutshell: I loved the first ten minutes, including the minimalist title sequence, and the eerie handling of 9-11.  Moore\\'s naked contempt for G.W. is palatable when it\\'s merely being insinuated.  It\\'s less so when he refers to G.H.W. Bush as G.W.\\'s \"daddy\"... but then I guess that\\'s what political discourse has become in this country.  As with \"Bowling for Columbine\", Moore\\'s film is most effective when read at arm\\'s length.  Many of his facts are incorrect, and the things he infers can be completely unfair, but some of the broader strokes (such as our cozy relationship with Saudi Arabia, or the increased fear-mongering of the media in the past few years) invite discussion, which is probably a good thing.

A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting.   Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience. One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. Working on an airplane or from a caf\\xe9 just felt wrong.    This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If you\\'ve used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I\\'m talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you won\\'t go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I\\'ve stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I can\\'t choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all.    And it keeps on getting better. 802.11 isn\\'t just a technology, it\\'s a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If you\\'re in a major city, chances are you\\'ll find one before you go a block. Forget 3G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control.    \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "indUnk", "file_name": "5114.male.25.indUnk.Scorpio.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Scorpio", "age": "25", "author_id": "5114", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      Mindjack T-shirts are  urlLink now available .

If there\\'s a message of the \\'for dummies\\' age it\\'s that nothing is beyond our grasp. And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhan\\'s meaning has been reduced to a one-liner.

Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully.

The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future. Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example. No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system. Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade.

His first article,   urlLink Redefining Television  , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium.  Here\\'s a snippet:   In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in  1984  and Ray Bradbury in  Fahrenheit 451  projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they weren\\'t that far off the mark. But here\\'s the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. Actually, they\\'ve already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this.  To understand why, we need to go back to first principles. What is television? Here\\'s a functional definition:   Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images.   This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era. Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies. \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "indUnk", "file_name": "5114.male.25.indUnk.Scorpio.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Scorpio", "age": "25", "author_id": "5114", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      I\\'m using this blog to play around with  urlLink Blogger\\'s new features .

 of course i\\'m guilty i attempted to party all weekend myself, but now as i sit here and reflect on things and try to remain perceptive into other peoples memorial day weekends, it almost saddens me to think of the family that has lost a love one in a war whether decades ago, or recently.  as they drive down the streets they see the weekend slumber and every one smiling having a great time enjoying their 4 day weekend - only wishing that they too could be doing the same thing sharing this weekend with the love one they lost.  as they turn on their radio to take away this haunting, disturbing, creepy feeling they are consumed with club and party promotions by the radio stations who are taking this weekend and its purpose and converting it into some sort of lucrative toss up to make some money as they promote a club.    i\\'m lucky, that i\\'m able to celebrate this weekend and not have to reflect back on any one in particular that i\\'ve lost - but how unfortunate for those who do not share that same luck.  we raise our flags, start the grill, crack a beer and our weekend has started, the celebration, has started. we as a society have lost sight of the meaning of this weekend, and i just hope that one day possibly next year i can make my own first step towards actually making it... a memorial day...and reserving my celebration for the day that truly is intended for it, independence day.  cool quote i found:  \" Soldier, rest!

 i\\'m just having to deal with the back lash of it in all honesty... dare i say i needed this?  well no i don\\'t think i did... i know what i\\'m doing with my life right now is all that i\\'ve wanted to do for several months i just never could find the time or motivation with always just wanting to be with sally doing whatever made her happy... with her absence i\\'m just able to find the time to accomplish all of these important tasks.  this month is working for her i\\'m sure - almost positive the relationship with her parents that she is trying to establish is being established.. and i\\'m sure they are giving her all the support that she needs to ensure that the goals she is setting out to complete in this month are completed.  i guess in essence we\\'re both doing the same things yet our worlds can not be compared.  college. i wish that i was able to live a simple life - where my parents would take care of the majority of my bills and the only thing i was responsible for was basically to perform well in school.  live with sally and go to school and leave the finances to mom and dad.  that would be outstanding... it would actually be perfect... but then on the flipside of that if that were to ever happen... i would loose the one thing that i value most in my life and thats the freedom to do what i want and make all my decisions without having to discuss them with anyone.  i guess the whole, \"no strings attached\" approach has its ups and its downs... i just don\\'t know. *sigh*    i\\'m just struggling with the gravity of reality that i\\'m totally on my own in this world.. and the only thing fairy tale about my life is sally.. she is too good to be true ... and right now... this minute... this hour.. this day.. this week... she  is ... to good to be true.    god i miss her.  - goodnight.   urlLink   \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      in a world that is so captivated and intrigued by love, you can not help but to ask yourself; what is the value of love?  well i suppose the answer to that question is different for each person, as is the definition of love.  in the last eight months i have surrounded myself around one person, for everything in my life that made me happy, that one person was always there and part of it.  in fact the only times i have been unhappy in the last eight months was when she wasn\\'t.  now i\\'m having to deal with more than i ever imagined i would have too.  i\\'m having to live in a home that *we* got together and wanted to live in.  now i\\'m living here alone, almost like a constant nightmare that does not go away no matter what you think about before you goto bed.  okay - i can deal with that because 90% of the reason she does not live here anymore is... my fault.    then on top of that i\\'m having to deal with this new...\"rule\".  you see sally moved back home and in order to maintain some sort of peace and a good relationship with her parents she has been asked to take an entire month \"off of me\" which means she can not see / talk to me - and if she does then she looses all that her family is doing for her (ex: a car, college paid for, ...).  In a month though we are going to be able to see each other, it will be \"her choice\" whether or not she wants to remain friends or anything more than that...and she will still have all of these wonderful things that her family is getting for her.  so i mean her decision can\\'t shock a whole lot of people, that she chose to do this thirty day deal with her parents ... because in all honesty in thirty days she can have the best of both worlds... right?  well i\\'m still not feeling \"settled\" with all of it.  Something just seems shady... almost like when thirty days is passed does her family actually say \"okay we don\\'t mind this now, you took a month off of him\" or do they say... look we got you all of these things too show you what life could be like for you... and you just go right back to him... i don\\'t know... blah... and its hard because i am waking up every morning being reminded of her absence... and for the last eight months all that i have known is her... and now she is gone so i\\'m even more at loss... really... blah i just don\\'t know what too do... *sigh* oh well i guess we\\'ll see how things play out in a month... well 29 days now ;)  yes i\\'m counting...   keep ya updated.  latah.\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      im a pretty cool guy with a whole lot too hide but its hard to get it out cause i got a whole lota pride thats the defense that attacks you when you try to peep my mind im not an apple pie i sin all the time whether i\\'m innocent or guilty of a crime my mind is on constant rewind my heart spews nasty slime through my mind turning it to words that rhyme or just a ball face lie never bad intentions just dont like to see you cry and its easier to lie and hide inside then to hang the laundry out to dry then i defeat my own purpose and make you cry and cant even answer the question of why this wont go away not in any near time the only thing i can do is figure out my mind before i disappear as if you went blind.. im my worst enemy but my war is with time..making a switch in my life to turn the sirens into chimes start focusing on dollars and not pinching the dimes everyone can hate me while i take this time but dont forget one thing remains mine.\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      today was a pretty simple day.  went to pick up  jessica a new friend of mine at her house way out in the ghetto right off of 8 mile.  well she don\\'t live in the ghetto but you have to pass through it to get to where she does live.  anywho picked her up... got lost on the way home but i finally got back on track and found the park i was looking for.. we went to the park for a little while and let capone right wild, that was fun, he enjoyed it - we just walked and talked... that was kind of peaceful.  we ended up watching dave chapelles hbo special, she had never seen it - so that was a lot of fun we did ALOT of laughing.  after that we were about to leave, and mike came up with some weed.  its funny how when you least expect it someone pulls weed out of no where isn\\'t it?

My love. My one true love. I wake up for this everyday. I breathe for this. I\\'m happy because of him. The smell of his hair. His family. His cats. His sense of humor. His eyes. His sweet attitude. His hands. His \"uh- huh\"s and free back rubs. Everything about him. I love it all. He completes me & theres nowhere else I\\'d rather be then in his arms, with the title \"girlfriend\".

I\\'M JUST HAPPY. & IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO MAKE HIM HAPPY.    now if you notice there was not a lot of creativity put into this, there was not a lot of fancy words, or an effort to rhyme, this was... i\\'m going to sit down... and just write how i feel.  amazing.    the second thing   i want to share - i\\'ve heard plenty of times but one of my readers sent it to me, and after the past few weeks - for the first time in my life... i can honestly say... it fits...     don\\'t cry because its over, smile because it happened....    this only fits because i have no regrets with sal, in fact i\\'m happy it happened.  i learned a lot about life, relationships, myself, fuck what didn\\'t i learn?

it just feels \"right\".  then another side of me is scared to get that close to her because i was just so close to being strong and independent of myself and my feelings, and whether i like it or not - it would be impossible for me to fight her breaking into my heart again.    in a perfect world her and i could be together and supported regardless of peoples personal feelings of me, they would have enough respect for her as a 20 year old woman to make the right decision, and not have to bribe you too make theirs.  but since this is an extremely opposite world - we are forced to hide our conversations, our talk, our meetings, our days and most importantly our love.  although i was thrilled to run errans with her, from the CVS to office max, to the hospital and back to my car... it was fun, great, enticing, and so comfortable... i even said at one point, \"i wish we were driving back to the tuson apartment right now.. god i miss living with you\".  the feeling i get when your around is just an overwhelming happiness that nothing else can replace - but that happiness comes with a price tag, and thats trust that she will always be there to offer me that happiness and vice versa.  it seems so much easier for her to cope and overcome disaster between her and i, and that is more than likely because of the constant fight she has to put up with her family for me, the... risk of loosing everything she gained when they thought i was gone.  when i\\'m not in the picture she has her sister who provides a gateway into a social life uncomparable to what i\\'ve been able to offer her in the past - then she has all of her family talking bad about me, and my motives.  so to her she is supported 100% in every way when i\\'m not in her life - which i\\'m sure doesn\\'t take away that void in her soul that i fill, but it does help take away the time she has to think about that void.    as far as anyone in her family is concerned right now though, i\\'m living in florida which makes things so much easier for her and i too see each other because when i \"lived in michigan\" they were too scared to let her out of their sight at the chance we may see one another...we made a plan today that she is going to go to college in kalamazoo this fall, and until then we will keep whatever it is we have going on, on the downlow... to stay under the radar and not get caught by her parents.  then when she goes to school her and i will have 4 hours distance seperating her parents from her, and that is truely what she needs.  be away from her family yet close enough to see them when she wants.  this will provide such an enormous amount of freedom for her to make decisions for herself, and in every way shape and form... be sally.    this is jumping the gun though, you see one of the main reasons i suffer so much from the harsh reality of loosing sally every now and then is because i do so much planning for the future with her - its like i get these visions and begin to form those into expectations... something that i really shouldn\\'t do... but i do.  so i will start today taking it day by day... because i mean we are not obligated too one another right now but at the same time we kind of are... we hug / kiss / say i love you / like a rebel love if you will.  its sad really.  so i\\'m not going to hang on too tight to this hope and dream that this fall sally and i will be able to embrace another relationship away from her family - but i\\'m going to keep it in the back of my head and pray that it happens.  we both still have an entire summer ahead of us that we have to bob and weave our way through so that this can actually happen - as we all know summer affords a lot of oppertunities for chaos... i just hope that we\\'re able to survive this.  *sigh*  \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      i think the poem actually speaks for itself -

what should i do?  this is the question i\\'m left pondering.  although i\\'m totally not in the mood to sit at home tonight i\\'m also really not in the mood to be in the \"club\" atmosphere.  i do have some options though lets see this is what has presented itself to me this afternoon.  1) Canada with like 12 people 2) Saginaw street 3) I\\'m making this one up right now - The Movies  i suppose the movies would be the best choice because i mean thats more along the lines of what im in the mood to do, now the question is, who the fuck do i go to the movies with?  everyone already seems to have plans.. i don\\'t have a girl (nearby) that i can take, blah.  maybe it\\'ll end up just a \\'steve night\\' - yeah.. that sounds rather refreshing actually, i think i might just go by myself to the movies.  now if you guys wanna show up and watch the movie with me your more then welcome.  i think i\\'m gong to go see the villiage at the star theater by great lakes crossing probably between 9-10.  this is just about the only thing i can think of doing that appeals to me, BUT who knows feelings change, moods change, plans change and then... you get an updated journal entry and see the result of all my trying to plan attempts.  okay i\\'m going to eat a bologna sandwich.    peace.  \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n       \"..help is on the way..\"  is what they chanted as john kerry made promises and gave hope to all americans in his speech.  it was almost as if i was watching a classic wrestling match, the way the crowd interacted with him and said it in unison.   it\\'s 4am and i\\'ve just finished watching the speech for the second time.  there were a few statements that he made that i just have to mention, so here i go :)   \"we don\\'t go to war because we want too, we go to war because we have too\"    \"And let me tell you what we won\\'t do: we won\\'t raise taxes on the middle class. You\\'ve heard a lot of false charges about this in recent months. So let me say straight out what I will do as President: I will cut middle class taxes.  I will reduce the tax burden on small business. And I will roll back the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals who make over $200,000 a year, so we can invest in job creation, health care and education.\"     \"The story of people struggling for health care is the story of so many Americans. But you know what, it\\'s not the story of senators and members of Congress.  Because we give ourselves great health care and you get the bill. Well, I\\'m here to say, your family\\'s health care is just as important as any politician\\'s in Washington, D.C.  And when I\\'m President, America will stop being the only advanced nation in the world which fails to understand that health care is not a privilege for the wealthy, the connected, and the elected \\xc2\\x96 it is a right for all Americans.\"    very cool john:  \"I want to address these next words directly to President George W. Bush: In the weeks ahead, let\\'s be optimists, not just opponents. Let\\'s build unity in the American family, not angry division. Let\\'s honor this nation\\'s diversity; let\\'s respect one another; and let\\'s never misuse for political purposes the most precious document in American history, the Constitution of the United States.\"    these are just a few of the awesome things that he said.  i would say although he seemed some what nervous at first, the speech was effective.  i\\'m looking forward to the next two months more than i have ever looked forward to it before.    maybe i should start another blog that i use for my political thoughts?

 i\\'m sure you\\'ve seen bits and pieces on the news - since this is my journal and not political oriented i\\'m not going to rant and rave about the convention, or my views, nothing like that.  i\\'m going to simply post an over view of trends i\\'m noticing.  one thing interesting about this election, is that \"blogging\" is actually becoming a voice on the web.  at this years DNC there is a whole slew of \"bloggers\" that were invited to come and document the convention, as part of the press.  that is amazing.  here is a picture of them setup at the convention.  this is something new that has never been done before, its as if we (bloggers) are begining to have an impact just as powerful is that of a journalist that types their opinion in the columns of worlds most powerful newspapers.  this is moving.    although my blog is more of a personal blog than a political blog, those of you that know me, know that i am very passionate about my beliefs and feelings on politics.  so i\\'ve added some links to the right hand side, that i\\'m reading every day to keep in touch with whats going on at the DNC, that we don\\'t see come through the tube.  also i was able to find a good article full of links and information about \" urlLink blogging from boston \".    so is everyone excited for a new president?

 so anyways sunday morning i went and picked chad up, and we drove out there together - it was a good road trip there was a lot of scenic shit.  none the less we got up there and found the camp ground (after using the fucking sun to navigate cause mapquest was WRONG!)  so we get up there my parents are not even @ their campsite so ... we go driving around this town to the sand dunes and look for them and low and behold we find them!! what are the chances, anyways sooooooo we ended up going out to the sand dunes in my dads truck... sunday night and having a complete blast out there, driving up these steep fucking hills and back down them... it was ... something you would have to experince my words won\\'t actually tell you anything... but you\\'ll be able to tell from the pictures what i\\'m talking about.  i watched my second sunset in my entire life!!

i\\'m not use to busy days :)&nbsp; it was nice.&nbsp; mike and i took the girls back to baycity.. we stopped for lunch on the way home at A &amp; W i didn\\'t realize how good their fucking food was - i was diggin that place.&nbsp; anyways i started the drive... and with the lack of sleep and the honestly not really paying attention... about 25 minutes into the trip... mike says, \"dude we\\'re going north..\" so yeah.&nbsp; i wasted alot of time driving in the completely opposite direction of home, so i pulled over and was like \"your driving\".&nbsp; so i got the chill for a few hours on the ride home - it was relaxing although i didn\\'t get to sleep as i had planned i was to caught up in the music... that happens sometimes.  &nbsp;  after we got back home we chilled for a few minutes, and went directly to my dads house to go pick up all of my shit that he was storing for me - that was fun.&nbsp; he is such a fucking idiot - he emails me and plays this hardass, that doesn\\'t give a fuck about his kids, implies he pretty much hates us, and then when i show up expecting the worst he is going to act like he is my best friend.&nbsp; what the fuck.&nbsp; i said maybe two words to him, for the first 20 minutes while we packed up the back of mikes truck - and then all of the sudden i think he kind of detected that there was some tension coming his way from me - and he out of know where offered me to use his van with the trailer so i only had to make one trip... awww how nice of you pops, its the least you could fucking do.&nbsp; i\\'m not going to complain, it made things a hell of a lot easier on time.&nbsp;&nbsp; so i got to mikes and just threw all of my shit in the garage where i\\'m going to store it for now... i think i\\'ll break into it tomorrow or something.. i don\\'t know.&nbsp; its going to be nice to have my desktop back though.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  anyways.&nbsp; so i left back towards my parents house to return the van and i heard a song... and the fucking song just fucked with me, i\\'ve heard it so many fucking times in the past but i\\'ve never listened to it - this time i listened to it ... and it fits... i dedicate to my parents (staind - for you).&nbsp; got back with the van and my dad had company over, so as i went to go give him the keys and let him know i was leaving he became dad of the year and offered me dinner.&nbsp; i was fucking shocked.&nbsp; (no matter how much i hate you i can\\'t turn down free food.)&nbsp; so i ate.&nbsp; then he said, \"why don\\'t you party with us tonight...\" i almost started having seizures.&nbsp; i think it is so funny that he thinks he can pop in my life and out of my life playing the dad role when its convient for him.&nbsp; when no one is around and he is just miserable, he don\\'t like me, or us for that matter.&nbsp; but god damnit if his friends are around he is a \"cool dad\".&nbsp; fuck you.&nbsp; i hate you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    your a piece of shit of an excuse for a dad and i regret every single day of giving you another chance to be there and be a dad  ... i should have went with my fucking mom to florida.&nbsp;   i fucking hate him  .&nbsp; but he don\\'t think anything is wrong with him, he thinks everybody else is wrong.&nbsp; lets look at the facts.&nbsp;     i moved out when i was 16  chad moved out when he was 17  lyndsey just moved out (she just turned 17)  kristyn left the day she turned 18   wow, i notice a fucking pattern.&nbsp; blah.&nbsp; i fucking hate him.  anyways so that was my night... well there was more but&nbsp;i can\\'t talk about it cause it just don\\'t involve me and it wouldn\\'t be very nice of me to divulge other peoples business... ya know?&nbsp; so yeah.&nbsp; hope you enjoyed my post... its the first one in awhile that i\\'m venting in.&nbsp; i\\'m pissed, i can vent right?&nbsp; i can\\'t be cool all the time.. shit gets exhausting ha.... alright enjoy ya\\'lls weekend :)  \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      so yesterday was interesting to say the least.&nbsp; mike and i met up with a girl and her friend (fahlon &amp; krystal) up in baycity - which by the way was a long fucking drive.&nbsp; so we went and picked the girls up, on the way home we stopped at burger king - which was kinda fun because they were wearing some skirts that were... lets just say \\'short\\', and well it was windy outside :).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  we got back to the house and just started to get fucked up.&nbsp; i\\'m not sure why, i\\'m not sure how, i\\'m not sure even... when... but i know right after we arrived here we started drinking.. and then we ended up out in the garage smoking... eventually we ended up @ tonic night club dancing and drinking.&nbsp; it was a pretty dope night - up until bed time, but thats another story in itself.  &nbsp;  i\\'m sitting on the floor right now because i had to be the gentlemen and let them sleep in my bed, and well i\\'ve been awake laying on the floor since 3 am with no sleep&nbsp;- finally i decided i was going to call it quits and just stay up today because it would be pointless for me to even sleep, i still have to drive them home.  &nbsp;  i\\'m not looking forward to today at all.&nbsp; as soon as i drop them off back in baycity i have to go to my dads house and pick up all my crap from the old place and bring it over here - something i\\'m not looking forward too, nor do i want to do.&nbsp;

OH WAIT.  at somepoint this afternoon... i went outside for a cigarette and the neighbors across the street were outside in a fist fight, i wish i had my camera that shit was funny.  capone was barking at them, trying to play cop dog and shit... haha it was funny.     so back to my day.  i just chilled today - around 9ish i went back to the techno festival - danced around quite a bit.. it was fun.  got home from that, had a glass of ice tea then went to kelly\\'s apartment and watched \"ghost ship\" that is an alright flick.  not anything i would ever want to watch again - but glad i watched it.  one of those things.    i\\'m feeling better about everything.  i honestly think having sarah, well not the concept of having sarah - but the \\'cloud\\' that over shadowed sarah and i\\'s friendship was putting more stress on me then doing me good.  your thinking, \"what cloud?\" - well the cloud of being friends but being that tad bit more?  we have all been there.  so i think with that out of the way, it is helping me cope with things better.  i wasn\\'t ready for anything other than a friendship - and i know that.  so now i can do this without a constant reminder of negetive shit.   i\\'m going to pick myself up, continue on with my journey, and keep writing my story.   -goodnight  after i posted tonight i had to come back and post this picture... i seen it and laughed - so if it makes anyone else laugh.. its worth posting :) enjoy!   \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      - capone shit  - cleaned up capones shit - went to techno fest - added new pictures to my pictures - started writing a book (more details later) - danced a lot tonight - kelly and jessica stopped over for a bit - talking to lynn right now - added new feature to site. i can now call a phone number from my phone and record a message and it will post here to the site for you guys to listen too, when i\\'m not able to find internet access and i want to post.  so sometimes you\\'ll get my voice opposed to this.

no.  then mike called and wanted a ride home from where he was at - so i didn\\'t end up going to bed until like 7 am this morning.  sucked.    today i\\'m going to see anchor man - and then heading out to downtown pontiac for the \\'techofest\\' which should be a blast, i\\'m excited for it anyways.  we\\'ll see how that goes.  bye.   does he kiss you and give you butterflys? do you see your future when you look in his eyes? when you touch his hand does it feel like hes your man? when you lay down does he play with your hair? when ever hes gone are wishing he was there? when you fuck each other do you think of me? do you just wish sometimes it was still sally and steve? when he holds you at night does he gently rub your sides? does he rub his fingers through your hair to let you know that he cares? when you drive in a car do you wish your destination was far? would he ever move to 2 different states to stay with you? would he ever sacarafice his entire life because it felt right and true? do you miss the comfort of waking up and not caring how you look? does he know what gets you going like he has read your book? when you lay with him at night do you ever see my face? when you goto your dreams am i still there in that place? do you wonder if i am thinking of you as much as you are of me? do you ever hear a song and just want to say i miss steve? do you ever think of our good times and just want to scream? do you ever look at where we were a year ago, and wish we could go back? do you ever look at the moon and think about how i wanted to give it to you? do you ever wonder if i\\'m still in love? do you ever wonder if i miss your kisses and hugs? do you ever wonder if im fucking? do you even care who i\\'m hugging?  does he kiss you and give you butterflies?

yes here is a picture sarah  so this is sarah.. she is dope.. very sweet.. very kind... and she is  very  independent. :)  anyways.. thats my day / night... and.. now i\\'m out like a gangster in a cop movie.. peaaaaaaaaaaaace!!!  oh wait. thought i would mention.... stuff magazine party.. detroit... july 17th... catch me in the august issue... i will be sittin V.I.P with mikey and the family... hahaha I\\'M PSYCHED!!!  -peace\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      today was kind of fun.  mike and i went to the \\'village square\\' which is a mall based outside.  very neat.  it is a shame that it was so hot that my shirt was becoming soaked and we ran to the car to get in the A/C.  *sigh*.  capone got some training today.  he now can catch a ball/toy in his mouth when you throw it up in the air.  neat eh?  i guess the \\'training\\' he got today was to just sit the fuck down and wait for me to throw the ball.  he learned it very quickly, i was really impressed.  i still can not believe how fucking smart this dog is.  after that mike decided he was going to do some home work so i took off to sarah\\'s house to pick her up, brought her back here - where mike was waiting for us.  we then proceeded to go to nick\\'s house and drink, tell jokes, and make fun of each other all night :)  it was... fun.  came back dropped mike off, then took sarah home, then came back here... (where i sit this moment).  i\\'m beginning to feel like the world is slowing down for me, opposed to a month or two ago i felt as if it was moving to fast for me to even plant my feet to attempt to catch up.  i feel like i\\'m slowing down time.. or i\\'m speeding up with it, and i\\'m beginning to catch up with everything about me.  is there still some things i want to change? of course there is - the only difference now is, i feel like i can find the time to change them, do them, and make them more meaningful rather than do things... and procrastinate until the last minute. (blah i\\'m rambling).  what i\\'m really trying to say is... i\\'m becoming more focused ... i\\'m becoming more ... myself again.. with each passing day it gets easier and easier.  today on the way home from sarah\\'s house i had all the windows down in my car and the music turned off, i was just doing some deep thinking.  wisdom is something that comes with age, and time, mistakes, failures.  now if i was as wise as i am now.. months ago - i would have never had to deal with the situation that i\\'ve had to deal with, but i wasn\\'t as wise then - in fact i was nieve.  through this i\\'ve become more wise, and less nieve.  i will never gamble \"myself\" for the hopes and dreams of anothers happiness.  never again.  so i\\'m becoming more wise - and as i was driving tonight... thats one positive thing i can say about all of this.  i\\'ve become more wise.. and since you can\\'t learn wisdom, and you can\\'t teach wisdom, its just ... experince... it feels good to know that i\\'m growing up... because.. wisdom is key to happiness.. because if your not wise.. happiness is easy to loose.    -goodnight.  ps. new picture of capone... more on my pictures page.  \\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n                   ...what..we were high @ 1:30 am...  ...more pics available in the picture section (link on right hand side).\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      i stare at your eyes and am too scared to see whats inside i lie awake staring at the ceiling wondering if this is keeping me from healing as much as i want this to grow i want it to be strong so lets keep it slow we are still friends but we both know its beginning to be as if this is all pretend the bridge of companion has not been crossed - but our friendship still remains at risk for loss a wonderful friendship filled with fun, to a relationship that i\\'m scared of and i might run  im beginning to feel as if its best we stay friends that way our beginning is guaranteed to have no end im not completely over her and this i cant pretend so please try not to be selfish and be there as a friend i just need some time to find what is mine again.  your to perfect in your own beautiful ways i totally enjoy your company every one of our days yet im beginning to loose my own fragile time i still need space for myself to reflect and unwind your friendship is rare and special to me i want more from you but right now this is all i need  friendship.\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      well lets see. last night i spent the night with sarah again and we had long exhausting sex until the sun came up, it was outstanding.  actually i\\'m kidding but thats what people seem to assume when you mention staying the night with someone, well another sex i suppose.  with all the partying going on neither one of us were really in the mood to do much of anything, so we decided that we would just chill out - so we went to her house and grilled out... chicken cabobs... haha they were dope.  ran up to the party store and bought a 12 pack.. and we just sat around and drank some beer and talked all night - it was very relaxing.. i was.. happy.     update:   today i TOTALLY RELAXED. it was wonderful.  at some point tonight i think around 12:30ish or so mike and i drove back out to waterford to meet kelly @ cvs and we smoked a bowl with her.... got some white castle after she finally found the one that she \"knew\".  yes that was wonderful.  that is all i did today it was a lot of fun actually.. i couldn\\'t have enjoyed today more.    tomorrows to do list: - bank - car insurance - condo - sprint - work at some point - possibly if time take capone out to park  thats it...   - peace & goodnight\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      well last night sarah, mike and i all went to kelly longs house and watched a movie...

 i have neglected to post about it in any of my posts, because of \\'doubt\\' with getting the job.  today was my second interview, this time with the regional manager, and i got it.  he will be calling me tomorrow to tell me when i start.  i\\'m fucking geeked.  i have to tell mah people now that i\\'m going to be leaving them, they will get over it.  so i got a job - that i wanted - that i will enjoy - that ... i like.  i will post more later on that subject.    after the interview which was out in the middle of no where (southfield) it really isn\\'t the middle of no where - but i wanna say it is, k? :)  afterwards on my way home i stopped by one of my friends worked and kicked it with them for a few minutes... then i went out to lunch... came home.  after i got home i chilled for a bit of time here, and then went over to twelve oaks mall with mike and we did some shopping, that was fun.  we came back home - i was bored with nothing to do so i got in my car and drove around for 2 1/2 hours ... just drove.  because thats what i do when i feel like i need to get my thoughts together or... need to do some thinking or figuring out.  it did not help, the more i thought, the more confused i got.  maybe one day i\\'ll be able to be candid about whats going on with me, but at this point, i wouldn\\'t even wanna talk about it.  because it is so personal and deep.  oh yeah the pictures from the other night are posted too - in the \"random\" folder.  i think by now you guys know how to get to my pictures - so i\\'m not going to tell you how.   i take a deep breath in slowly it comes out i begin to listen to my mind but it just shouts  i wish i could tear my heart apart so it would die i might not love again but i\\'d feel better inside  im torn in two my face is blue all because of you im getting weak why this week dont fall stay on your feet  i wish i could pen to the world how i truely truely felt but that would be like giving an abusive dad a belt  im trapped in my own mind its like a land mine every where i step i have to take my time  im want to rip open my head and show you whats inside im not sure what it is but i know it isn\\'t kind  such a different person i am this very night if i knew why i think i\\'d be alright  im just frustrated with where im at in life im just frustrated i have to start all over finding my light.   that just came out as i was typing the post.  sorry for having such a negetive post, but if you review my last like uh 30 posts i don\\'t think you\\'ll find a negetive one so i think i\\'m entitled to being \\'down\\' once in awhile... this was my night.  dont read too much into it, you might hurt yourself.  comments are off on this one.   -goodnight\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      today was interesting to say the least.  i felt like i needed \"alone time\" today.  i took capone to the local college campus here, and we bonded for about two and a half hours, he played fetch, then we relaxed, then went for a long walk.  it was rather refreshing, and allowed me to get some thoughts under control.  it was peaceful.  on the way home i stopped by an old friends house too see if they were even still alive, which they were.  so i spent about 3 hours at their house, then i came back too drop capone off.  went back to their house picked them up and we drove around all night, and just talked about did a lot of catching up.  i feel like i got a lot off of my chest, i mean i have people too talk to that i wouldn\\'t trade for the world, but when you have someone to talk too who knows and has witnessed and has seen with their own eyes some of the things you want to talk about - it makes things a lot more relieving for the mere fact they can give you their opinion based on knowing the past, and the people involved in it.  so it was interesting, insightful, and entertaining.  tomorrow is going to be a very busy day - i\\'m totally not looking forward to it, but hey i guess busy days are a whole hell of a lot better than lazy boring days.  it kind of takes you through life, but life with meaning or something.  so thats whats poppin on my end of things... i haven\\'t checked to see if kel posted the pics of last night or not.. i guess i will check right now.

Kelly: theyre on my computer but not one livejournal or nothing im about to pass out   so i guess i\\'ll have those up tomorrow, or whenever she is able to get them over to me.  they are funny.  okay i\\'m in for the night.   -latah\\r\\n     \\r\\n\\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "Marketing", "file_name": "9289.male.23.Marketing.Taurus.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Taurus", "age": "23", "author_id": "9289", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n       \\r\\n      before i forget let me write these funny quotes down from tonight   \"can you imagine if peter parker was high?\"    \"steve this thing is so long and big\"  (burrito at taco bell)   \"is this the CD?  no. then how are you starting it over? im not, its the radio.\"  (Eminem - Stan)  so tonight i was pretty fucking bored.  so i decided to go out with kelly and talk bullshit and have some fun, it ended up being kelly, jessica, nick and i but we still ended up having a goodtime - after we found some \"goods\" we went and smoked, in kelly\\'s apartment complex, afterwards we decided that it\\'d be fun to go pull some secret bullshit off (can\\'t write here) - we ended up going but not being able to pull the secret bullshit off.  it sucked - actually in retrospect i think we may have had a chance, had we not been high of course.  the odds against us just seemed to increase being high.  who knows.  tonight was pretty intoxicating though.  i don\\'t think i\\'ve laughed as much and as hard as i did tonight, in a long time.  in a real long time.  but tonight just seemed so genuine and peaceful.  there was just a lot of good karma tonight, i really enjoyed it - we all had a complete blast and we all were involved in the chaos in the car.  it was fun.  i definitly could never smoke weed habitually but once or twice a month, i dont mind it.  especially on a night like tonight where you are with the right people and there is that awesome karma going on, positive atmosphere, its nice and relaxing.  anyways so i\\'m home now its 3:42 am.  saturday night i went over to my parents house for a get together, i brought capone with me.  it was a good time lots of people over, including my favorite person in the world, lyndsey.  yes saturday lyndsey saw my dad for the first time since may when she moved out, not just saw him but, she talked ot him.  it was sad.  she got there with her boyfriend and they walked out into the backyard back by the pool, where everyone was swimming.  she went and hugged my mom, and then over to my dad and he wouldn\\'t let go of her, and they told each other they loved one another - and after all of that he actaully spoke to ryan like ryan was a person.  called him boss at one point in the night too, which was a bit odd.  none the less it was nice to see them overcome that huge obstacle, i know exactly how it feels for our dad to finally accept someone who he hated in the past.  it takes a lot of stress away.  so we partied there that night for a little while.   haha i put saturday first.  friday night i had to go to bed early because i had my dodge ball game saturday morning.  i didn\\'t end up going to bed of course until 5 am because lynn and i talked all night, it was fun though.  so with my two hours of sleep, at 7:30 am i was at royal oak kimball high school for this dodgeball game.  the game was alright, for us not ever playing dodgeball in a professional enviroment, we did damn good.  2nd place out of 27.  it was kind of suprising actually because when mike created the team over their website, he did it in the competitive league.  well, we got there and we found out realy quick we were suppose to be in the recreation league.  oh well - couldn\\'t change it - so we totally were the underdogs and came out on top.  it was fun.  then all the bullshit i already posted above i did saturday night and today.  i realize i typed this backwards but mi erus uoy nac erugif ti tuo.    so that was my weekend.  and thats the end of my post.  -cheers.

I guess Dana leads the group...   I think ive read this like 5 times now.. and every time i read it i mean to leave a comment but I am either amazed or speechless at the end! I   You seem to have a lot of lady fans! Kepp it up lol    one of my favorites:  Your smarter than you act...    i liked this one a lot too:  ok i already told you this in IM but imma tell you again...this i think has to be my fav of yours. your stregnth amazes me...but you amaze me just about every day steve. you deserve to have a smile on your face at all times...and you deserve ALL the happiness in the world.   lynn   this was funny:  you & mike = PIMPS  the end.   lynn    this was touching:  Steve.. You are such an amazing person. You inspire me with your perseverance & strength. You have the ability to do what ever you want to do in life, and I\\'ve told you that since the day I met you. You have this amazing quality about you that warms a room up. You have the personality that so many guys wish they had themselves. I\\'ve never met anyone like you - and I must say through the years it has always been a privilge to have you in my life. Your such a doll and I\\'m sorry for all that you\\'ve went through, I\\'m glad your remaining positive and staying on top of life without allowing it to get on top of you. Your amazing.  Forever Friends,  ~Nicole Stockwell :)    this one makes me smile when i read it:  w/e bitch! i knew where it was! lol u got ur sick ass white castle but those chicken things are kinda good- but maybe just cuz we smoked b4 that?      touching as well:  Steve,  You know you\\'re like a big brother to me. It\\'s scary because you\\'ve been more of a big brother to me than my own brother has. I never really tell you but you mean a lot to me. As you\\'ve seen before, I\\'m always going to be here for you. Even though you may do something that prevents us from talking for long periods of time, I\\'ll always be here if you need me. I know you\\'re confused about a lot of things that are going on in your life right now, but you know that things will eventually work out for the best. Sometimes things have to happen to make your life better. All you have to do is try not to think about the things that have gone wrong, and think about the things you\\'ve gained back since that thing went wrong. Example: Me. :D haha anyway. As I was saying, you\\'re a great guy and you deserve a great girl. You seriously deserve nothing less than the best. I know that when you give your heart to a girl you give it 100%, and if that girl can\\'t appreciate that..she doesn\\'t deserve you. I\\'ve been here for you since you were in the army with nothing to do but get on the internet and chat in vzones. I\\'ve heard about many things that have gone on in your life. One thing I\\'ve noticed about you is that you always pull through and come out of it learning something that makes you a better person. Just know that it will get easier, and you will find a girl that will make you happy. Just give it time and try not to think about the bad things. I\\'m going to end this here because I think I\\'m getting too mushy. I\\'ll talk to you tomorrow.  Love ya Steve, Alice    yea, this was original. worst comment so far:  hayy ur hott i have no idea who u r though i was on a website and then saw ur pic and i clicked on it so if u ever want to talk or somthin im me on xxblondebabe77xx    okay so those are the comments that I found that stood out.

This is a true story, or so I have been led to believe. It was told to the mutant by his friend \"Jack\". Jack related the story to me during our discussion of the mental illness we have all come to know as \"flag worship\".  I should mention that my friend Jack is an accomplished liar, given to exaggeration of details, so he may have made it all up on the spot.  Jack is a mechanic. He works for a company that owns a fleet of vehicles and heavy equipment. He keeps the machinery running and he likes his job. Jack is fighting terrorism his way.  A few days before the anniversary of 9/11, Jack was approached by his employer with a nice new American flag.  \"Jack, I just bought a flag.\"  Jack peered at the nice new clean flag from beneath a layer of grease and dirt, \"I am happy for you. What does this mean to me?\"  \"You are the mechanic,\" says the employer, in the way that employers do when what they are saying flys solidly into the face of logic. \"Can you build us a flagpole?\"  \"Yeah, I suppose I could. But it will take time away from working on our vehicles. I am not doing this on my own time.\"  \"Of course.\"  And so, Jack set off to build a flagpole. Jack is a mechanic mind you, he is not a flagpole engineer. He has other things to do, important things that generate income for his company. But he got on with it anyway.  Jack computed the availability of basic materials on hand, those that had to be purchased, the location selected for the pole atop the building, the size of the flag, how much time this project would detract from his regular cash-producing duties, lightning, low-flying aircraft, rabid bats, what he could get away with, and so forth. Based on these figures, Jack produced a flagpole atop the office. Old Glory fluttered in the breeze. Sighting it from the relative safety of his garage, Jack puffed with satisfaction on his Marlboro.  But all was not well my friends. No. For as we shall see, a horrible sickness began to take hold of the office workers.  In the vocabulary of flagpole engineers, people whose life work is the study of upright cylinders crowned with a loop of rope and and pulleys and the ability of said structures to loft a brightly colored cloth into high visibily, Jack\\'s flagpole was \\'half-assed\\', a first year student\\'s attempt at an art form best left to professionals. The office dwellers complained to Jack that when there was little wind, a tiny bit of the drooping colors scraped against the roof, fraying the edge of the flag.  \"It\\'s not that bad,\" says Jack. \"No one can see that, it still looks OK.\"  \"It\\'s a brand new flag. It has to come down until you make the pole higher,\" says the employer.  \"That will cost more money and more time. An extension will have to be added to the pole. And I will have to build a new bracket.\"  \"That\\'s fine, do whatever you need to do.\"  And so Jack removed the flagpole from the roof, built a new bracket to hold an extension, and remounted the pole to the roof. Satisfied with his work, Jack returned to his garage to find something really greasy and dirty and profitable to work on.  The flagpole looked good, the office dwellers all agreed, and they cheered Jack\\'s accomplishment, they glowed with patriotism, and the sickness, moved in with them.  \"Jack, can you mount some lights under the flag so it can be seen it at night?\"  \"Who is that going to impress?\" says Jack from behind a cloud of smoke that was once a flagpole-like cylinder of selected fine tobacco.  \"What?\" The sickness affects hearing first. \"We should have lights shine on our flagpole. Can you do that?\"  I\\'ll kill this shit thinks Jack, \"Yeah, but we should really have our electrician do that sort of work.\"  \"That\\'s OK.\"  \"Is it? The electrician has to come out of the city. It will cost more time and more money.\"  The increasingly larger dollar signs had still not yet registered in the employer\\'s brain, \"Money is not the issue. Do whatever you need to do.\"  Jack contacted the electrician and an appointment was set. In the meantime, high winds during a storm broke the bracket and sent the top half of the pole, flag and all, crashing down to the roof. A mournful wail erupted from the sickened office workers. The peaceful nastiness of Jack\\'s garage was once again shattered.  Jack\\'s employer gave up on the whole project, by passing the responsiblity on to the office manager. By this time, the sickness was in full bloom. The office worker\\'s need for the flag had grown beyond normal boundaries. It was the crack-pipe of patriotism, around which they all rallied. They needed more.  The office manager confronted Jack, \"We want to erect a new flagpole. How soon can you get it up there?\"  \"Look, as long as we keep mounting it to the roof it\\'s going to be a problem. We will have to weld it. Our welder will have to weld the poles and we\\'ll have to mount it on the roof very securely. We are talking about a very difficult job, more money, more time, and it will continue to be a problem. We need to bail on this deal. This flag is a bad idea. It has been nothing but trouble.\"  The manager conveyed the news to the office workers, but the sickness was undeterred. They decided to instead erect the pole in the front parking lot. And they still wanted lights to shine up on the flag.  And so it was that Jack removed the flagpole and sought out the assistance of the welder, who is a marine corps veteran.  An interesting side-note, the welder is eighty years old, he was told by a gypsy fortune-teller when he was a child that he would die on his twenty-first birthday. This is no problem he thought, I just won\\'t be anywhere dangerous on that day. But the welder was a marine, and as fate would have it, on his twenty-first birthday, he was face-down on the beach at Okinawa, with bombs and machine-gun bullets and parts of bodies flying all around him, and all he could think about was that fucking gypsy. He\\'s done his part for his country. And now he has to deal with sick people who cannot begin to guess at what patriotism really is.  The welder agrees to help out, but new materials are needed. The poles Jack has been using on the roof won\\'t do.  Being a veteran, he points out that if they erect a pole of this kind, the flag must be raised in the morning and lowered in the evening. It must then be folded into a triangle. And what\\'s more, because the flag has touched the ground, it has been desecrated, and must be burned.  Jack thinks this is fine idea. Jack thinks that this is the best idea he has heard in a long time. Indeed, burning the flag, this flag, would give him a positive hard-on. His brain erupts in visions of the flag and the office building consumed with flames, workers running to and fro within, helpless, unable to escape, and himself, watching from his garage, reassembling a carburetor, whistling a happy gospel tune.  Jack is on his way to the trash burning spot with the flag in one hand and a can of kerosene in the other, the word goes out across the yard, and the crew rushes to stop him.  The welder goes on to explain that the flag cannot simply be burned in order to cast out the evil spirits. No. They must take the flag to the VFW Hall. There they will arrange a ceremony complete with uniforms, guns, a bugler to play taps, a chaplain, an altar, a pentagram, a virgin girl scout to sacrifice, and so on. Flag burning, as with flag ownership, and flag display, implies a lot of silly-assed rules and ceremonies so it seems.  The welder took the flag with him to the VFW Hall, so if you don\\'t get the girl scout cookies you ordered this year, now you know why. Sickness takes a toll.  Soon thereafter, Jack is called into an office meeting. He stubbs his cigarette out at the door before entering, but he keeps it, unlit, dangling out of his mouth. Jack is particularly greasy today, approaching pure nasty. As he takes his seat among his co-workers, he is the portrait of someone who whose time is being wasted at faster-than-light speed.  \"What is this all about? I\\'m busy,\" he grumbles.  \"We need to decide who is going to raise and lower the flag,\" says the office manager.  \"What flag?\"  \"This is important. We need to decide how this will be handled.\"  \"Do I have this right? I had to stop working to come into a meeting to decide who will raise the flag that we do not have on the flagpole that we also do not have?\"  The office manager can\\'t take it anymore, \"Can I see you in here for a moment?\"  They go into a private office.  \"Geez Jack, what are you a communist?\"  \"No. I am a nazi.\"  \"Oh God, Jack, don\\'t say things like that. People don\\'t think that kind of talk is funny.\"  \"Ja, I am really.\"  \"Look Jack, it\\'s just a little flag.\"  \"No. If I have a little flag on a wooden stick,\" waving his unlit cigarette to demonstrate, \"That is a little flag. You are holding a meeting for something that does not exist. I have a transmission scattered out across the garage in ten-thousand pieces that has to be reassembled and working to do a job at eight AM tomorrow that will make money for the company which is what we are all here to do.\"  \"I get it, OK. Go.\"  And go he did. The manager returned to the meeting, \"I don\\'t know. I guess he\\'s just un-patriotic...\"  Indeed. I am Jack\\'s complete lack of patriotism.  The sickness swept across the company, and with it now came the labels, \"Jack is un-american. Jack is a communist. Must be a democrat. Child abuse, I heard. A satanist...\" They just could not understand it. Why would anyone hate the flag so much?  Thou shalt have no other god before me. Unless it\\'s the flag. Amen.  Jack is approached by his employer, who has quite wrongly determined that he can bring Jack back into the fold. Jack decides to snap his boss back into reality.  \"How much money have you spent on this flag deal?\"  \"Well, the flag was a hundred dollars.\"  \"And you have paid me over two days wages to deal with the flag.\"  The boss can\\'t believe this, \"It can\\'t be that much.\" Sick people can\\'t count.  \"Go figure.\"  He did. The boss figures he has spent almost four-hundred dollars on a flagpole that he does not have, for a flag that he does not have. Isn\\'t that special?  Now. The electrician. Remember the electrician? The electrician has arrived to put lights on the roof to shine up on the flag, the flag that isn\\'t there, on the flagpole, that also isn\\'t there.  Jack had fun explaining to the electrician that there was not, in fact, any flagpole, and that the flag had, in fact, been burned in some bizarre ritual at the VFW Hall. He also advised him that if these people didn\\'t get a new flag soon there might be trouble, so he should watch his ass.  The office manager had fun trying to explain where the flagpole would be, and where the lights that will shine up on the flag will go. Since they did not know how high the pole would be, the lights had to be highly adjustable. He also asked the electrician to put a timer on the lights since it was determined in yet another office meeting that nobody wanted to be bothered to turn the lights on and off manually, let alone raise and lower the flag. Sickness causes laziness.  The electrician had fun presenting his estimate for the work that had to be done. And in descibing how much of the the lot must be dug up to install pipes to carry the wires to power the lights. No doubt, he also had fun telling his co-workers about these hillbillies he went out to give an estimate to that day.  Since the company had its own equipment for digging ditches, all the electrician had to do at this point was mark out where the pipes would be laid, avoiding gas lines, phone lines, and so on, and return when they were ready.  Enter the boss\\'s idiot son.  The boss\\'s son has never operated a ditcher. But since this work was on company property, now was his opportunity to learn. Are you getting ahead of me yet?  So he\\'s running the ditcher. Once it starts it\\'s pretty well automatic and only needs to be turned when neccessary. Jack and his co-workers note that the little boss is coloring outside the lines a bit.  \"The line turns back there,\" Jack yells over the machine noise, \"Don\\'t you need to turn the ditcher now?\"  \"Yeah, I\\'m going to turn it over here, in a minute.\"  Jack knew better and walked over to the ditcher to turn it. Just then, there was a flash of light and a hell of a noise. Sparks and pipes and wiring shot out of the ditch.  The power goes out at the office, and the apartment complex next door, and the convienience store and the strip center nearby. The phones aren\\'t working either. No cable tv. And all eight-hundred feet of the DSL fiber-optic cable, all the way back to the junction box, has been ripped out and wrapped around the ditcher\\'s impeller.   Now, power and phone services are easy enough to repair, but the DSL cannot easily be fixed. The repairmen do not know where the pipes are exactly, so, for two weeks they dig ditches up and down both sides of the road looking for them. And then a few days more while they dry out the pipes with nitrogen.  Meanwhile, the company cannot do billing because the DSL is down, (don\\'t ask me why). So, no money coming in.  The computer guy resorts to stealing the modem out of Jack\\'s computer, the only one with a modem, to build a proxy and get everyone back online.  Once the crisis had passed, Jack inquired of his employer what the situation with the flag was. Jack is funny that way.  \"Fuck that flag,\" the boss said.  It is estimated that the company was now into the flag for over three-thousand dollars.  Three-thousand dollars. For a flag they didn\\'t have. On a flagpole they also didn\\'t have.  Is there a point to my story? Well, fuck if I know, you people expect a lot when you click that little mouse don\\'t you?  We were talking about sickness. When illness stikes, the body tries to expell it however it can. Sneeze it out, cough it out, sweat it out.  The mental illness of \"flag worship\" is different. Only a really good beating will get it out of your system.  Well anyway, that\\'s Jack\\'s prescription.  ---The Happy Ending---  Jack was going through some old toolboxes and found a set of stickers. He went through the office passing them out.  \"One for you, and one for you...\" he sang as he went along.  He reached the office manager with the last one, \"And one for you...\"  \"All right! I know just where to put it,\" said the office manager, slapping the American flag sticker on the side of his computer monitor. \"That\\'s great!\"  Indeed it was.

Now, as I see it, the only people who would not appreciate the fact that my website outranks their own would be people with something to sell. Goodness me, my discount used gasmask website is being outranked by a weblogger, that can\\'t be right can it? That\\'s just unpatriotic. Yes, it can, and it probably is. I had something current to say about gasmasks, your tired old static content cannot compete. (I am talking about gasmasks right now, Google will see this, cache it, and add it to search results for gasmasks. Do you get it?)   \"There are no detailed, published standards issued by Google...\"  Try including some current news about your gasmasks, with some outside linkage (get a blog dummy), use \\'current event\\' words and phrases and news related to what you are selling, use Blogdex, use Daypop, use your brain, get some friends to link to you, be a meme-whore, then Google will stand up on it\\'s hind legs and speak for you, that\\'s the trick, that\\'s the only trick that Google-dog knows. Popularity can be a good thing. People don\\'t like static websites, I don\\'t anyway, and in my observation, neither does Google.  I wish I had something to sell on this website, I\\'d be doing pretty well thanks to Google...  Of course, you could, God forbid, pay Google to put your website at the top of their search results page. I realize that just by mentioning payment for search referrals I have opened a quantum vortex that has caused the assholes of webmasters to pucker-up all over the solar system, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Oops, I did it twice didn\\'t I?   \"Google penalizes webmasters who take advantage of their algorithms.\"  Who gives a rat\\'s ass? The guilty will be punished. For example. There is a javascript available from  urlLink here , that allows referrers to your website to be linked on your page, it\\'s pretty cool. I installed this at the bottom of my webpage. A few days later I discover that I have lots of new friends, most of my referrals are now coming from porn sites who have nothing to do with my site, they are all just taking advantage of my little script. So sadly, the script had to be removed. Long story short, no one likes being taken advantage of. Not this little grey mutant.  Besides all that. I have to laugh. I do, I\\'m fucking sorry. What kind of idiot other than the \"Make A Vast Fortune At Home Selling Porn And Viagra On The Internet\" variety would concern themselves with Google\\'s secret algorithms? I mean, there is no vast fortune to be made on the Internet, I know that for a fact, I did a search for it on Google, I hit the \"I\\'m feeling gullable\" button, and I didn\\'t find a damn thing.   Google enjoys a 75 percent monopoly for all external referrals to most websites...  What you fail to mention here is that this massive number of referrals are very likely generated by a minority of users. We are busy mammals, but we are few. Do you think most people even know that they can change Internet Explorer\\'s search page from MSN to anything else? Do you think most people even know that they can change Netscape\\'s search page from Netscape to anything else? What do AOL users search with? Earthlink users? Do you think that Grandma even knows that Google exists?  Now. Maybe I just don\\'t see the big picture. Maybe Google is a New World Order storefront, rife with ex-spooks who want nothing more than to use our webpage viewing habits against us? Today veblogs, tomorrow ze verld...  But I am a very practical mutant, Google likes me, likes my weblog, so I like Google.  urlLink Kiss kiss... \\r\\n     \\r\\n    \\r\\n", "industry": "indUnk", "file_name": "8173.male.42.indUnk.Capricorn.xml"}, {"astrological_sign": "Capricorn", "age": "42", "author_id": "8173", "gender": "male", "text": "\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t \\r\\n       urlLink It\\'s a good idea to crouch down and wrap your head and body in a white sheet.

A military coup has taken place in the United States--the year is 2012--and General Thomas E. T. Brutus, Commander-in-Chief of the Unified Armed Forces of the United States, now occupies the White House as permanent Military Plenipotentiary. His position has been ratified by a national referendum, though scattered disorders still prevail and arrests for acts of sedition are underway.  A senior retired officer of the Unified Armed Forces, known here simply as Prisoner 222305759, is one of those arrested, having been convicted by court-martial for opposing the coup. Prior to his execution, he is able to smuggle out of prison a letter to an old War College classmate discussing the \"Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012.\" In it, he argues that the coup was the outgrowth of trends visible as far back as 1992. These trends were the massive diversion of military forces to civilian uses, the monolithic unification of the armed forces, and the insularity of the military community. His letter survives and is here presented verbatim.  It goes without saying (I hope) that the coup scenario above is purely a literary device intended to dramatize my concern over certain contemporary developments affecting the armed forces, and is emphatically not a prediction. -- The Author   urlLink America\\'s military coup  \"...if there\\'s a sentiment in the army it is: Support Our Troops, Impeach Rumsfeld\".

It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs (and aggregation sites) are most influential in the propagation of memes. The dataset from this experiment will be public, and can be located via Google (or Technorati) by doing a search for the GUID for this meme (below).  The original posting for this experiment is located at: Minding the Planet (Permalink: http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/a_sonar_ping_of.html) --- results and commentary will appear there in the future.  Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate -- the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.
